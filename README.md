The COVID-19 pandemic, which emerged in early 2020, has had far-reaching effects on global economies, leading to significant disruptions and workforce reductions. As companies sought to navigate the unprecedented challenges posed by the pandemic, many implemented mass layoffs as a necessary cost-cutting strategy. This analysis aims to explore layoff trends globally from 2020 to 2023, pinpointing the sectors and countries that were most impacted and identifying companies that experienced the highest levels of layoffs.

Goals :  
This analysis aims to explore layoff trends worldwide from March 2020 to March 2023 using structured data exploration through SQL. The main objectives are to identify trends in layoffs over time, determine which industries and countries are most affected, and highlight companies with the largest number of layoffs. The methodology involves querying and aggregating data using SQL to uncover patterns and generate insights, focusing on key variables such as total layoffs, industry, company, country, and funding stage. The approach is purely exploratory, with the goal of presenting data.  

Insights :  
-  The highest number of layoffs reached 12.000 people, with some companies reporting layoffs that amounted to 100% of their workforce.
-  A large number of companies have carried out layoffs, with the rate reaching 100%. 116 companies have implemented these drastic measures, highlighting the severe impact of economic pressures and changing market conditions on the workforce.
-  The company with the highest number of layoffs is Katerra in the US, with a total of 2434 people.
-  The company that gets the most funds is Britishvolt (UK). Despite raising an impressive $2.4 billion in funding, Britishvolt still ended up laying off all of its employees.
-  Amazon cut over 18.000 employees, Meta laid off more than 11.000, and Google reduced its workforce by 12.000 in early 2023. This trend is strongly reflected in the data, where tech companies dominate the top of the layoff charts, in terms of total_laid_off.
-  The consumer and retail industries are the top industries with the most employee layoffs; besides that, COVID has a huge impact on many fields such as transportation, finance, health, etc.
-  Total laid off always increases from 2020 to 2022 and drops back in 2023, with a peak in 2022 with a total of 160k.
-  The country-wise layoff data shows that the United States leads by a wide margin, recording over 256.559 layoffs, making up the majority of the global total. India follows in second place with approximately 35.993 layoffs, likely driven by its fast-growing tech and startup sector. The Netherlands, Sweden, and Brazil round out the top five, each experiencing layoffs in the range of 10.000 to 17.000 employees.
-  From March 2020 to March 2023, a total of 383,159 layoffs were recorded. The number steadily increased over time from 9,628 in March 2020 to 80,998 by the end of that year. After modest growth in 2021, a major spike occurred in 2022, with layoffs jumping to over 257,000. By March 2023, the cumulative total had reached its peak. This trend highlights how the global job market remained under pressure long after the initial impact of the pandemic.
-  Each year’s top layoff contributors: 2020: Uber, Booking.com, Groupon; 2021: Katerra, Zimyo; 2022: Meta, Amazon, Cisco; 2023: Google, Microsoft, Salesforce, Dell

Conclusion :  
- From 2020 to 2023, over 383,000 layoffs were recorded globally, with a major spike in 2022. The tech industry, after rapid growth during the pandemic, became one of the hardest hit—seen in mass layoffs by companies like Amazon, Meta, and Google.
- A total of 116 companies laid off 100% of their workforce, with Katerra having the highest count, and Britishvolt collapsing despite raising $2.4B in funding. This shows that even well-funded companies are not immune to failure.
- The U.S. led in total layoffs, followed by India and the Netherlands, while the consumer and retail sectors also saw major cuts. These patterns highlight how the impact of global crises shifted over time and stress the need for sustainable business and workforce strategies.
